Minimize waters
 &cntrl
  imin = 1,      ! Perform an energy minimization
  ntx = 1,       ! Read Coordinates, but no velocities
  irest = 0,     ! Do not restart the simulation
  ntmin = 1,     ! For NCYC cycles the steepest descent method is used then conjugate gradient is switched on
  nmropt = 0,    ! No nmr-type analysis will be done
  maxcyc = 2000, ! The maximum number of cycles of minimization.
  ncyc = 1000,   ! The method of minimization will be switched from steepest descent to conjugate gradient after NCYC cycles.
  ntpr = 100,    ! Frequency of printing of the energy and its components.
  ntwr = 250,    ! Every ntwr steps during dynamics, the “restrt” file will be written.
  cut = 10.0,    ! Non-bond cut off
