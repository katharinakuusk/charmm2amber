; This is an gromacs port of the amber LIPID17 force field made by Zhiyi Wu
; in the the Structural Bioinformatics and Computational Biochemistry Unit at
; University of Oxford. The amber to gromacs format conversion is first done
; with ParmEd 3.2 (https://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd). I have written a script to
; condense all the bonded interaction into a force field format, provide the
; corresponding gro file for every lipids, and validate the energy to make sure
; the gromacs port yield the same energy as the original amber format.
;
; The user can construct the lipid bilayer using charmm-GUI and convert the
; coordinate file use the script charmmlipid2amber.py.
; Custom head group or acryl chain can also be used with the LIPID17 to
; make custom lipids using pdb2gmx.
;
; The whole project and more detailed explanation is accessible from
; https://github.com/xiki-tempula/gmx_lipid17.ff

; When use in conjunction with amber protein force field, the following
; section needed to be commented out.
